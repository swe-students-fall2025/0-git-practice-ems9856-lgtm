## What I Find Interesting
I found it interesting to see the speed at which generative AI can improve efficiency. It turns out that using Co-Pilot has helped double the speed in which code can be written. But it is important to note that other aspects of coding and development are part of the software creation. Companies need to adapt not only in writing code, but in all aspects of their business, including security and organization. AI will only help grow companies and industries as fast as other areas of the enterprises can develop.
